In 2002, artist Francis Alÿs gathered 500 volunteers on a sand dune near Lima. They dug along the peak until the sand had been displaced by four inches. That the participants managed to move the dune only a small distance—infinitesimal against the landscape and the scale of time—mattered less than its implication. To achieve in a day what would have taken the wind years to do—an allegory of the collective power, a metaphor for human will.
